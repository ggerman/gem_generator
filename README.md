### **Custom Gem Generator (Thor-Powered)**

This Thor script automates the creation of a new Ruby gem by generating a structured project setup. It initializes:

- A `.gemspec` file with the custom gem name
- A `lib/` directory with a main Ruby file
- A `LICENSE` file (supports GNU 3 License)
- A Git repository (`git init`)

This tool simplifies gem creation, allowing developers to focus on building functionality rather than setting up boilerplate. ðŸš€
